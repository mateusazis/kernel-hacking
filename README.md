# Linux kernel hacking guide

This is a guide about how to setup a working Linux virtual machine from scratch (compiling the kernel yourself!).

You can check the `README.md` file for each lesson for the step-by-step guide.

In a hurry? You can also run the `run.sh` command on each lesson to just execute all the commands in the lesson (note that some lessons require you to take some actions during those commands in a way that cannot be automated by a shell script).

This guide has been developed and tested on Ubuntu 22.04.
